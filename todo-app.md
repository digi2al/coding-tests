# To do app

This coding test is to build a small web app to capture a to-do list. The 
features that form the to-do app are described as [user stories]. There are 
some [technical requirements] that we require you adhere to. Finally we have 
some [expectations] that describes what we expect from you.


## User Stories

*As a* forgetful person  
*I need* to record things I need to do  
*so that* I will never forget them

*As a* proactive person  
*I need* to see the to dos I haven't yet done  
*so that* I can pick the next one to do

*As a* successful to do doer  
*I need* to mark a to do as complete  
*so that* I don't see it on my list of unfinished to dos

*As a* person with demands on my time  
*I need* to prioritise my to dos  
*so that* I don't forget which are most important to do


## Technical Requirements

- Feel free to use any languages, libraries or frameworks you like
- Use as little client side Javascript as you can


## Expectations

All of these expectations are up to your own judgement. If you think you should
you can deviate from these expectations.

**We expect:**
- A Restful API
- A simple web frontend
- A Readme that describes what you've built and how to run it

**We don't expect:**
- The app deployed anywhere
- A complex, detailed frontend design. Simple bootstrap or plain HTML is fine.
- Data to be persisted in a database.
- Exhaustive documentation

We have expectations that we have not documented here. Use your best judgement.
